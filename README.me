You will first need to enable dev / API functionality on your reddit account. You can just google how to do that. This will give you a client_id and client_secret to use in your script.

Then open up the script and fill in the parameters to the `praw.Reddit(...)` call.


The script works by posting comments to /r/FreeKarma4U which is basically a karma farming sub. This used to be an innocuous sub where people would post random pics and users would upvote every post and every comment just to help people generate karma. *The sub is still used to generate karma... but the posts are all pornography now.* So just be warned about that. The script should still do its job either way. Just run it for a few hours and you'll get karma. Kill it and run it again to help refresh the karma generation rate.
